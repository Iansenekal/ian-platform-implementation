## 70.11 Document Workflow + eSign - Approve/Reject Actions and Escalations

LAN-only - POPIA-friendly - Explicit Approve/Reject - SLA-driven escalations

Document Control
- Document ID: `docs/70-Document-Workflow-eSign/70.11-Approve-Reject-Actions-and-Escalations`
- Filename: `docs/70-Document-Workflow-eSign/70.11-Approve-Reject-Actions-and-Escalations.md`
- Version: `v1.0`
- Date: `2026-02-10`
- Owner: Compliance + Platform Ops
- Status: Workflow Standard
- Hard requirements: explicit decisions; no auto-approval; full auditability; MFA on approvals
- Related docs: `70.10`, `70.60`, `70.70`, `04.30`, `03.30`

## 1. Purpose
- standardize Approve and Reject semantics across document types
- define reminders, SLA timeouts, and escalation paths without approval-by-silence
- define version-bound rework loops with full traceability

## 2. Non-Negotiable Rules
- No auto-approval on timeout or inactivity
- Approve and Reject are the only valid sign-off outcomes
- Reject reason mandatory
- MFA required for approvals via UI and email action links
- escalation may notify or reroute but never approve automatically
- all actions must emit audit events bound to `correlation_id` and document hash reference

## 3. Action Definitions
### 3.1 Approve
- attests current document version meets step criteria
- requires valid role/scope membership, MFA, no-self-approval, and current-step state
- creates approval record and advances workflow to next step or completion
- emits audit record with actor, method, timestamp, decision, and hash reference

### 3.2 Reject
- marks current document version as not acceptable; rework required
- requires valid role/scope membership and current-step state
- requires reason code (and optional category)
- transitions instance to Rework, notifies author, blocks publish/index paths
- preserves rejection record bound to rejected version only

### 3.3 Request changes handling
- for high-assurance flows, treat change requests as `Reject` with reason category `Changes Requested`
- avoid non-terminal ambiguous states

## 4. Step SLAs, Reminders, and Escalations
### 4.1 SLA behavior
- each step defines `SLA_HOURS`
- timer starts at step activation
- reminders before breach and escalations after breach

### 4.2 Reminder defaults
- reminder 1 at 50% of SLA
- reminder 2 at 80% of SLA
- reminders sent to active approvers and optional workflow-admin watch list

### 4.3 Escalation defaults
- escalation 1 at 100% SLA: notify approvers + manager/compliance groups
- escalation 2 at +24h: optional reroute to alternate group and notify original group
- escalation 3 at +48h: notify GM-level group and create incident/task
- escalations never auto-approve

## 5. Rerouting and Substitute Approvers
- reroute is privileged admin action requiring MFA and reason capture
- prefer delegation where possible; delegation remains time-bounded and auditable
- reroute must remain scope-constrained to site/department/project unless explicitly approved

## 6. Completion and Finalization
- final step approval completes instance for current version
- finalization seals evidence entries for that version
- document transitions to final/read-only state per storage policy
- subsequent revisions start new workflow instances

## 7. Email-Based Approve/Reject
- email contains explicit Approve and Reject actions
- action links are signed, time-limited, identity-bound, and MFA-gated
- Reject must capture reason through secure authenticated path
- forwarded links must not bypass identity binding

## 8. Failure Modes and Safe Defaults
- email delivery failure: continue with UI approval path; emit `EMAIL_DELIVERY_FAILED`
- invalid token: deny action and emit `APPROVAL_TOKEN_INVALID`
- MFA unavailable: deny approval and require recovery/break-glass process
- empty approver group: fail closed with `CONFIG_ERROR` and admin notification

## 9. Evidence and Audit Events
- `WORKFLOW_SUBMITTED`
- `APPROVAL_STEP_ASSIGNED`
- `APPROVAL_REMINDER_SENT`
- `APPROVAL_ESCALATED`
- `APPROVED`
- `REJECTED`
- `REROUTED`
- `WORKFLOW_COMPLETED`

## 10. Verification Checklist
1. Validate correct step assignment on submit.
2. Validate approve advances step and emits audit event.
3. Validate reject requires reason and transitions to Rework.
4. Validate new version resubmission does not reuse prior approvals.
5. Validate reminder thresholds and notifications.
6. Validate escalation triggers without auto-approval.
7. Validate reroute requires admin + MFA + reason and is audited.
8. Validate email action links enforce identity + MFA and deny user mismatch.

## 11. Client Rollout Variables
- per-step SLA hours
- reminder thresholds
- escalation timing/recipients
- alternate approver groups and reroute policy
- reject reason category requirements
- email action token expiry
- MFA policy for approvals
