# 83.30 Pre-Bootstrap Go-Live Gate (Final OK to Run Deterministic Bootstrap)

Document ID: `docs/83-PrePhase-Integration/83.30-PreBootstrap-GoLive-Gate`  
Version: `v1.0`  
Date: `2026-02-10`  
Owner: `Platform Owner / Release Manager`  
Status: `Go/No-Go gate`

## Purpose
Strict auditable gate to confirm readiness before running deterministic bootstrap.

## Rule
If any required item is `NO/FAIL`, do not proceed. Remediate and re-test first.

## REQUIRED
All sections below are required gate checks and must have attached evidence before a `GO` decision.

## Gate Sections
1. Environment identification complete.
2. Proxmox host readiness (81.*) PASS.
3. VM base readiness PASS.
4. DNS readiness (83.10) PASS.
5. LLM pointer readiness (82.*) PASS.
6. Pre-phase integration tests (83.00/83.10/83.20) PASS.
7. Backup and evidence readiness (06.*) PASS.
8. Change control and rollback readiness PASS.

## Evidence Requirement
Attach command output/screenshots/logs for each PASS line item. Record remediation for each FAIL and rerun evidence.

## Repo Artifacts
- Gate markdown: `infrastructure/prephase/tests/83.30-prebootstrap-go-live-gate.md`
- Inputs template: `infrastructure/prephase/tests/83.30-go-live-gate-inputs.env.example`
- Optional report generator: `infrastructure/prephase/tests/83.30-go-live-gate-report.sh`

## Execution
1. Fill the inputs template.
2. Run report helper:
   - `bash infrastructure/prephase/tests/83.30-go-live-gate-report.sh --env-file infrastructure/prephase/tests/83.30-go-live-gate-inputs.env`
3. Review output and sign formal decision.

## Decision
- `GO`: all required checks pass with evidence attached.
- `NO-GO`: one or more checks fail or evidence is incomplete.

## Sign-Off
- Platform Owner / Release Manager
- Security Architect
- Platform Ops
- Client IT Owner (optional)
- Change Manager (optional)
