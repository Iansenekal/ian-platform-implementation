# AI Platform Pre-Phase Integration

## 83.30 Pre-Bootstrap Go-Live Gate

Final "OK to run deterministic bootstrap" sign-off checklist  
Purpose: Provide a strict, auditable gate to confirm infrastructure readiness BEFORE executing the deterministic bootstrap.  
This checklist is mandatory. If any item is NO/FAIL, do not proceed until remediated.

## Document Control

## How to use this gate

- Complete each section in order.
- For every YES/PASS, attach the referenced evidence output (command output, screenshot, log file).
- For any NO/FAIL, record remediation actions and re-test the section before signing.
- When complete, sign the bottom "OK to run bootstrap" approval.
