## 1. RBAC Principles and Scope
- enforce authorization across identity groups, API authorization, and storage/search ACL inheritance
- Nextcloud folder ACLs are authoritative for content visibility
- separation of duties for contributor/reviewer/export approver where possible
- deny-by-default for all unauthorized role/scope combinations

## 2. Baseline Roles
- Voice-Admin
- Voice-Operator
- Voice-Contributor
- Voice-Reviewer
- Voice-Reader
- Voice-Auditor
- Voice-Export-Approver

MFA baseline:
- mandatory: Voice-Admin, Voice-Auditor, Voice-Export-Approver
- mandatory for Restricted workflows: Voice-Reviewer

## 3. Permission Matrix Summary
- Contributors upload to Intake only
- Reviewers access PendingReview and perform approve/reject/redaction
- Readers consume Final within project scope only
- Export requires explicit Voice-Export-Approver decision
- policy/retention/rule changes are Voice-Admin only

## 4. Group Naming and Mapping
Recommended pattern:
- role groups: `VOICE-ROLE-<RoleName>`
- project scope groups: `PROJ-<ProjectCode>-VOICE-<Tier>`

Role grants capability; project group grants scope.

## 5. Nextcloud Folder ACL Mapping
- Intake: contributor write; reviewer read; reader none
- Work-InProgress: service + operator only
- PendingReview: reviewer/operator only
- Final: reader/reviewer/operator scoped by project
- Evidence-Pack: auditor/compliance read-only
- Exports-Restricted: export approver + compliance only
- System-Internal: service accounts only

## 6. Gateway/API Authorization Rules
- all endpoints require authenticated identity
- job operations require role + project scope
- state rules enforced: no indexing from PendingReview; no export without approval record
- unauthorized attempts logged without content leakage

## 7. Search and Graph Visibility
- search filtering follows Nextcloud-derived ACL inheritance
- graph must not expose hidden nodes through edges or suggestions
- mind-map explanations are ACL-filtered

## 8. Sensitive Workflows
Review/redaction:
- approve/reject with mandatory reason for rejection
- redaction actions are auditable

Export:
- exceptional flow requiring explicit approval and evidence record
- exported outputs go only to approved restricted destinations

## 9. Privileged Access Controls
- MFA required for privileged roles
- break-glass constrained per break-glass policy
- periodic access reviews for role and project-scope groups

## 10. Verification Checklist
- role tests confirm no privilege overreach
- contributor cannot access PendingReview
- reviewer approve/reject requires reason capture
- unauthorized users cannot discover restricted transcripts in search/graph
- export blocked without approver role and approval event
- service accounts are minimally scoped

## 11. Client Rollout Variables
- IdP mode and MFA role matrix
- role and scope group naming conventions
- restricted workflow policies
- export approval chain
- service account scoping model
