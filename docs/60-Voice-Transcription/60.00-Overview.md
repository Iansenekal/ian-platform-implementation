## 60.00 Voice + Transcription (Whisper) - Overview

LAN-only runtime - POPIA-friendly - Two-VM on Proxmox (+ optional GPU ASR VM) - Ubuntu 24.04

Document Control
- Document ID: `docs/60-Voice-Transcription/60.00-Overview`
- Filename: `docs/60-Voice-Transcription/60.00-Overview.md`
- Version: `v1.0`
- Date: `2026-02-10`
- Owner: Choice IT / Platform Ops + Security + Compliance
- Status: Design + Operational Standard (mandatory when Voice is enabled)
- Scope: voice capture, transcription, indexing, and graph linkage
- Hard requirements: LAN-only; POPIA-friendly; least privilege; auditability; retention controls
- Model policy: US/EU-origin AI/ASR model artifacts only
- Related docs: `60.10`-`60.90`, `21.*`, `30.*`, `03.*`, `06.*`, `50.*`

## 1. Module Purpose
- convert approved audio/video sources into searchable transcripts using Whisper-class ASR
- produce auditable artifacts (audio, transcript, metadata)
- feed Nextcloud, Search, and Knowledge Graph with ACL-aligned visibility

## 2. Platform Positioning
Integrates with:
- Nextcloud for authoritative artifact storage
- Search/KG for indexing and relationship linking
- Gateway for controlled APIs and orchestration
- IdP for SSO/MFA and role mapping
- Monitoring/Logging and Backup/DR for operations and evidence

## 3. Primary Use Cases
- meeting transcription
- incident debriefs
- training transcript generation
- approved field-note ingestion
- compliance evidence support workflows

## 4. Scope and Boundaries
In scope:
- approved audio ingestion and transcription jobs
- transcript storage with ACLs
- ACL-inherited indexing into search/graph
- retention and purge controls with evidence

Out of scope:
- public/internet-facing transcription endpoints
- covert surveillance use
- telephony/call-center ingestion platform

## 5. High-Level Lifecycle
1. capture/upload audio
2. enqueue transcription via Gateway
3. ASR processing on approved worker
4. optional human quality/redaction gate
5. persist transcript + metadata to Nextcloud
6. index to OpenSearch with ACL inheritance
7. link graph nodes/edges under permission constraints
8. apply retention and purge policies

## 6. POPIA Control Baseline
- purpose limitation and explicit classification per job
- minimization-first handling (avoid unnecessary sensitive data)
- strict ACL and least privilege
- retention-class tagging and auditable purge

## 7. RBAC and Audit Baseline
Minimum roles:
- Voice-Admin
- Voice-Operator
- Voice-Contributor
- Voice-Reviewer
- Voice-Reader
- Auditor (read-only evidence access)

Mandatory events:
- upload create/update/delete
- job create/start/complete/fail
- transcript access/export
- redaction/approval actions
- purge execution outcomes

## 8. Operational Baseline
- queued job execution with bounded concurrency
- optional reviewer quality gate
- controlled export and redaction workflow
- observability for queue depth, latency, failures, storage growth

## 9. Deployment Options
- CPU mode on AI-DATA01 for low volume
- dedicated GPU ASR VM for throughput and isolation
- LAN-only runtime for both options

## 10. Prerequisites
- IdP SSO/MFA and group mapping
- Nextcloud ACL blueprint in place
- Search index policy baseline and ACL enforcement
- Gateway RBAC/audit enforcement
- monitoring and backup scope defined

## 11. Definition of Done
- upload, transcribe, store, and index flow works with correct RBAC and audit
- no ACL leakage in search/graph
- retention and purge controls active with evidence
- baseline monitoring and restore-test evidence captured

## 12. Implementation Order
- `60.10` architecture/data flow
- `60.20` ports/boundaries
- `60.30` storage model
- `60.40` RBAC
- `60.50` retention
- `60.60` audit events
- `60.70` search/indexing integration
- `60.80` verification checklist
- `60.90` client rollout variables
