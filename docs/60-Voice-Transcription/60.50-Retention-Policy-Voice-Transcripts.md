- Document ID: `docs/60-Voice-Transcription/60.50-Retention-Policy-Voice-Transcripts`
- Filename: `docs/60-Voice-Transcription/60.50-Retention-Policy-Voice-Transcripts.md`
- Version: `v1.0`
- Date: `2026-02-10`
- Owner: Compliance + Security + Platform Ops
- Status: Policy Standard
- Hard requirements: enforced retention; minimization default; auditable purge; legal hold support
- Related docs: `03.40`, `60.30`, `60.60`, `06.40`, `21.60`

## 1. Policy Objectives
- enforce POPIA-aligned minimization and purpose limitation for voice data
- keep retention consistent across storage, search index, and graph references
- preserve purge evidence without preserving purged content
- support controlled legal-hold and exception handling

## 2. Retention Model
- assign `retention_class` at ingestion using stable class keys
- retention applies to record set: audio + transcript + metadata + receipts + evidence
- coordinated purge across Nextcloud, OpenSearch, and Knowledge Graph
- retention start is ingestion `created_at` unless policy override is documented

## 3. Standard Retention Classes
Recommended baseline classes:
- VOICE-30D
- VOICE-90D
- VOICE-1Y
- VOICE-3Y
- VOICE-7Y
- VOICE-LEGAL-HOLD

## 4. Retention Decision Matrix
Default mapping by source type and sensitivity:
- training: VOICE-1Y baseline
- safety briefing: VOICE-1Y to VOICE-3Y when incident-linked
- operations meeting: VOICE-90D or VOICE-1Y when justified
- incident debrief: VOICE-1Y, VOICE-7Y, or LEGAL-HOLD by policy
- voice note: VOICE-30D default
- compliance evidence recordings: VOICE-7Y or LEGAL-HOLD

Restricted and high-risk categories are review-gated before indexing.

## 5. Legal Hold and Exceptions
- legal hold can be placed/released only by authorized compliance/legal roles
- hold placement records scope, reason, start date, approver, and audit reference
- hold blocks purge until explicit release
- retention deviations require approved exception record in evidence artifacts

## 6. Purge and Evidence Requirements
Purge must remove:
- audio/video artifacts
- transcript and segment outputs
- non-required personal metadata
- derived search/preview/highlight data
- graph nodes/edges referencing purged artifacts

Evidence must include:
- recording_id and record-set references
- retention_class + policy version
- timestamp + actor
- pre-purge fingerprints
- completion status for storage/index/graph
- failure ticket/remediation when partial

## 7. Enforcement Points
Nextcloud:
- scheduled purge from retention metadata and folder state
- PendingReview included in retention controls

OpenSearch:
- retention_class + expiry timestamps on transcript index records
- remove searchable content and snippets at purge

Knowledge Graph:
- remove/de-reference purged transcript links
- no ghost nodes in mind-map

## 8. Data Subject and Privacy Considerations
- shortest viable retention by default
- minimize identifiers in filenames and sidecars
- restricted classes treated as sensitive workflows
- support data-subject request process via Compliance policy

## 9. Verification Checklist
- every new record has retention_class + sensitivity label
- decision matrix applied by source type/sensitivity
- purge test confirms removal from storage/index/graph
- evidence record retained without full content
- legal hold test validates purge block/unblock behavior

## 10. Client Rollout Variables
- class durations for VOICE-30D/90D/1Y/3Y/7Y
- matrix overrides by project/department
- legal hold approver groups
- purge schedule and execution window
- evidence retention duration
- index retention enforcement strategy
