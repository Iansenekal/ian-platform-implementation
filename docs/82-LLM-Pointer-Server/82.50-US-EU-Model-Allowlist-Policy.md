# 82.50 LLM Pointer Server US/EU Model Allowlist Policy (Procurement, Enforcement, Audit)

Document ID: `docs/82-LLM-Pointer-Server/82.50-US-EU-Model-Allowlist-Policy`  
Version: `v1.0`  
Date: `2026-02-10`  
Owner: `Security Architect / Platform Owner`  
Status: `Mandatory`

## Purpose
Define strict sourcing policy for on-prem Ollama runtime: only US/EU origin models are allowed, with enforceable controls and auditable evidence.

## Scope
Applies to `ai-llm01` and future inference nodes, including base models, fine-tunes, adapters/LoRA, embeddings, rerankers, and related artifacts.

## Policy Statement
Only models with approved US/EU provenance may be downloaded, stored, or executed. Unknown or disallowed provenance is prohibited.

## Roles
- Platform Owner: approves allowlist entries and exceptions.
- Security Architect: validates provenance controls and audits compliance.
- Platform Ops: executes approved pulls and records evidence.
- Developers: request models with justification; no direct self-install.

## Authoritative Files
- Allowlist: `/opt/ollama/config/model-allowlist.yaml`
- Model inventory records: `/opt/ollama/config/model-inventory/`
- Approval records: `/opt/ollama/config/approvals/`

Repo templates and scripts:
- `infrastructure/ollama-gpu/82.50-model-allowlist.yaml.example`
- `infrastructure/ollama-gpu/82.50-model-inventory-record.example.json`

- `infrastructure/ollama-gpu/82.50-allowlist-audit.sh`
- `infrastructure/ollama-gpu/82.50-evidence-checklist.md`

## Required Allowlist Fields
- `model_id`
- `ollama_ref`
- `type`
- `origin_region` (`US` or `EU`)
- `source`
- `provenance_notes`
- `approved_by`
- `approval_ref`
- `approved_date`
- `intended_use`
- `data_classification_limit`
- `retention_logging_policy`
- `checksum_policy`

## Procurement Rules
- Approved source only: official publisher/registry/repo.
- Controlled internet windows only for acquisition.
- No unverified mirrors, random links, or unmanaged re-uploads.
- No production pulls without approval record.

Mandatory workflow:
1. Request with business need and data classification.
2. Platform Owner + Security Architect provenance decision.
3. Approved change/ticket issued.
4. Platform Ops acquires and captures checksums/evidence.
5. Allowlist + inventory updated.
6. Pull allowed only after allowlist update.

## Enforcement Controls
Minimum required in production:
- Outbound internet blocked by default; temporarily opened only during controlled admin windows.
- Pulls executed via allowlist wrapper only (`82.50-allowlist-enforced-pull.sh`).

Additional controls:
- Restrict pull capability to Platform Ops sudoers group.
- Optional read-only model store outside maintenance windows.
- CI/release checks for allowlist and inventory consistency.

## Audit Controls
Weekly audit (`82.50-allowlist-audit.sh`):
- Export installed models.
- Compare installed models to allowlist 1:1.
- Confirm inventory evidence per installed model.
- Confirm approvals and checksums exist.
- Generate audit report for evidence pack.

## Exceptions
Exceptions are rare, time-bound, and require written sign-off + expiry date. Expired exceptions require model removal and retained evidence.

## Client Rollout Variables (filled)
- Model approver: `admin account (choice)`
- Approval reference format: `CHG-YYYY-####`
- Allowlist path: `/opt/ollama/config/model-allowlist.yaml`
- Evidence retention: `180 days`
- Outbound internet policy: `blocked by default, controlled admin-only windows`
- Audit frequency: `weekly`

## Verification Targets
- Wrapper blocks non-allowlisted pulls.
- Installed model list equals allowlist entries.
- Inventory + approval evidence exists for each installed model.
- Weekly audit reports are generated and retained.
