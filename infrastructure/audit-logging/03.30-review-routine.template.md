# Audit Review Routine Template

## Ownership
- Audit review owner: <name/role>
- Backup owner: <name/role>

## Cadence
- Daily triage: failed logins, deny events, auth anomalies
- Weekly review: privileged actions, role/group changes, unusual download/share events
- Monthly compliance: retention checks, index health, access control review

## Escalation Triggers
- Failed login spikes above threshold
- Unexpected external sharing events
- Unauthorized role/permission changes
- Repeated firewall policy changes outside maintenance windows

## Evidence
- Preserve exports with timestamps and reviewer sign-off
- Link to incident/change ticket IDs
