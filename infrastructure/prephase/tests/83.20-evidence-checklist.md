# 83.20 Evidence Checklist

Capture and preserve:

- `ufw status verbose` + `ufw status numbered` from AI-DATA01, AI-FRONTEND01, and LLM.
- `ss -tulpen` listener snapshot from all three nodes.
- Successful SSH proofs from allowlisted admin to all three nodes.
- Failed SSH proofs from non-allowlisted host to all three nodes.
- `nmap` results from non-allowlisted host (targeted scans minimum).
- LLM policy proof:
  - AI-DATA01 -> LLM `/api/tags` pass
  - non-allowlisted host -> `/api/tags` fail
  - AI-FRONTEND01 behavior matches policy
- Blocked datastore port checks from AI-FRONTEND01/non-allowlisted host (`5432`, `9200`).
- Full runner log: `infrastructure/prephase/tests/logs/83.20-security-smoke-*.log`.

Store evidence per `06.40` retention policy.
